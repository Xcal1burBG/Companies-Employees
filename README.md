Problem: A list of Employees is given and the program has to return a Dictionary<string,int> holding the names of the companies and the average age of their employees.
The task is taken from HackerRank and is a little bit modified so that the List<Employee> is not coming as a method parameter but the employees are entered by the user as follows: 
{FirstName(string)} {string SurName(string)} {Age(int)} {Company Name(string)}, separated by space
